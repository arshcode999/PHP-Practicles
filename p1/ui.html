    <p>AI, or artificial intelligence, is the field of computer science that studies and creates machines or software
        that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. AI has many applications in various domains,
        such as industry, government, science, education, entertainment, and more. Some examples of AI systems are web
        search engines, recommendation systems, speech recognition, self-driving cars, and game-playing agents. AI is
        also a subject of interest for philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and ethics, as it raises questions about
        the nature and limits of intelligence, consciousness, morality, and responsibility. AI is one of the most
        exciting and challenging fields of the 21st century.</p>
